# Portal System for java edition

This works on JAVA EDITION version of minecraft for other versions like bedrock or pocked edition I'm not sure because I've never tested. 

## Beta vesrion
Please note that this is the beta version of the portal system that I've made.  And yes it does work on multiplayer(CO-OP) But it can be quite laggy because the resource is not optimized. Unllike in real portal game where you have 1 gun for everything in Minecraft things're handled a bit differently you get 3 guns 2 for creating portals and one for picking up items and portal related every gun is activated by right mouse click for item picker there is a known bug when entity is in front of you cannot perform right-click action in that case you have to use shift key also known as crouch key.

It is known that the Mapmaker tool can slow the game down. That's why is disabled by default. You have to manually enable in settings. This is also in development.
